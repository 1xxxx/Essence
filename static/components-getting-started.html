        <h3 class="e-headline">
                Essence is available as a npm package. For dependency
  management and JSX transformations, you can use browserify
  and reactify. Since the CSS framework is written in Less, you'll
  need to compile that as well.</h3>
        <h3 class="e-display-2 e-padding-top-50 e-text-blue-600">React-Tap-Event Plugin</h3>
        <h3 class="e-headline">
                A few components use react-tap-event-plugin to listen for touch
  events. This temporary dependency exists since react v1.0 was
  not yet released. Once that happens, this plugin will no longer
  be required. In the meantime make sure to inject this plugin at
  the start of your app.</h3>
