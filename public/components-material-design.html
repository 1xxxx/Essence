        <p class="e-display-1 line-height-12 e-text-green-500">Material is the metaphor</p>
        <p class="e-subhead line-height-12 e-text-grey-700 e-text-left">A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a system of motion. The material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.</p>
        <p class="e-subhead line-height-12 e-text-grey-700 e-text-left">Surfaces and edges of the material provide visual cues that are grounded in reality. The use of familiar tactile attributes helps users quickly understand affordances. Yet the flexibility of the material creates new affordances that supercede those in the physical world, without breaking the rules of physics.</p>

        <p class="e-display-1 line-height-12 e-text-green-500">Bold, graphic, intentional</p>
        <p class="e-subhead line-height-12 e-text-grey-700 e-text-left">The foundational elements of print-based design — typography, grids, space, scale, color, and use of imagery—guide visual treatments. These elements do far more than please the eye. They create hierarchy, meaning and focus. Deliberate color choices, edge-to-edge imagery, large-scale typography, and intentional white space create a bold and graphic interface that immerse the user in the experience.</p>
        <p class="e-subhead line-height-12 e-text-grey-700 e-text-left">An emphasis on user actions makes core functionalityimmediately apparent and provides waypoints for the user.</p>

        <p class="e-display-1 line-height-12 e-text-green-500">Motion provide meaning</p>
        <p class="e-subhead line-height-12 e-text-grey-700 e-text-left">Motion respects and reinforces the user as the prime mover. Primary user actions are inflection points that initiate motion, transforming the whole design.</p>
        <p class="e-subhead line-height-12 e-text-grey-700 e-text-left">All action takes place in a single environment. Objects are presented to the user without breaking the continuity of experience even as theytransform and reorganize.</p>
        <p class="e-subhead line-height-12 e-text-grey-700 e-text-left">Motion is meaningful and appropriate, serving to focus attention and maintain continuity. Feedback is subtle yet clear. Transitions are efficient yet coherent.</p>
